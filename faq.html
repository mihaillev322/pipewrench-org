<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<details>
<summary>What is a pipe wrench used for?</summary>
<p>A pipe wrench is a specialized plumbing tool designed to grip and turn pipes, fittings, and cylindrical objects. It uses serrated jaws and a self-energising angle so the bite increases as you apply turning force, making it a reliable wrench for pipes when high torque is needed.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I position an adjustable pipe wrench for maximum grip?</summary>
<p>Set the jaw opening so the pipe contacts the heel jaw and the hook jaw fully. The hook jaw should lead in the direction you are turning. If the wrench is reversed, the pipe wrench grip is weaker and slipping becomes more likely.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What pipe wrench sizes should I own for general plumbing?</summary>
<p>For many international household tasks, a 250–300 mm (10–12 in) adjustable pipe wrench covers common pipe diameters. Add a smaller 200 mm (8 in) for tight spaces and a larger 450–600 mm (18–24 in) for stubborn fittings or heavier duty pipe wrench work.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can a pipe wrench be used on chrome or polished fittings?</summary>
<p>It can, but it will often mark the surface because the teeth are designed to bite. For visible finishes, consider a smooth-jaw alternative or protective methods, and reserve pipe wrench tools for hidden or robust fittings where bite marks are acceptable.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Pipe wrench vs monkey wrench: what is the real difference?</summary>
<p>A pipe wrench has serrated jaws and a geometry that increases bite under load, making it a dedicated pipe fitting tool. A traditional monkey wrench is typically smooth-jawed and better for flat-sided fasteners or situations where you want less surface damage, but it is not as secure on round pipe.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the safest pipe wrench techniques for high torque?</summary>
<p>Use steady pressure rather than sudden jerks, keep your body out of the slip path, and use a second wrench as a hold-back when needed. Confirm the jaws are fully seated and the handle is aligned to reduce side-loading that can cause the wrench to walk off the pipe.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I maintain a pipe wrench so it keeps biting properly?</summary>
<p>Clean debris from the teeth, lightly lubricate the adjustment mechanism, and inspect the hook and heel jaws for rounding. Replace worn parts if the design allows. Proper pipe wrench maintenance improves grip and reduces the chance of slipping.</p>

<table>
<caption>Pipe wrench troubleshooting: symptoms, causes, and corrections</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Symptom</th>
<th>Likely cause</th>
<th>Correction</th>
<th>Why it works</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Wrench slips under load</td>
<td>Hook jaw facing the wrong direction or jaw too loose</td>
<td>Flip orientation and tighten adjustment until fully seated</td>
<td>Correct geometry increases bite as torque rises</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pipe surface heavily crushed</td>
<td>Wrench too large or excessive leverage</td>
<td>Use a smaller wrench and controlled force; consider hold-back</td>
<td>Reduces contact stress and improves control</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Teeth clog with debris</td>
<td>Dirty worksite or corrosion</td>
<td>Brush teeth and wipe jaws after use</td>
<td>Clean teeth restore consistent pipe wrench grip</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adjustment nut binds</td>
<td>Lack of lubrication or contamination</td>
<td>Clean threads and apply light oil</td>
<td>Smooth adjustment prevents misalignment</td>
</tr>

<p>These troubleshooting steps address the most common pipe wrench problems encountered in field use. Regular maintenance and proper technique prevent most issues, while understanding the underlying causes helps develop better working habits with pipe wrench tools.</p>
